Test: Create an Iterator filtering framework: (1) IObjectTest interface with a single boolean test(Object o) method 



and (2) an implementation of Iterator (let's call it FilteringIterator) which is initialized with another Iterator and 



an IObjectTest instance: new FilteringIterator(myIterator, myTest). Your FilteringIterator will then allow iteration 



over 'myIterator', but skipping any objects which don't pass the 'myTest' test. Create a simple unit test for this 



framework.
